## The course involves four project topics are considered:
- Topic 1: Space-tim downscaling of sea surface dynamics
- Topic 2: Space-time interpolation of SSH fields from satellite altimetry data
- Topic 3: Short-term forecasting of sea surface dynamics 
- Topic 4: Eddy segmentation 

**Associated resources:**
- For Topics 1, 2 and 3, a NATL60 dataset for a Gulf Stream region is available: cf.
